# THE BODY-MASS INDEX CALCULATOR

The body-mass index calculator program was created with Python programming language which has been deployed on Heroku.

Visit the live site: [The Body-mass index](https://body-mass-index-calculator-1e646be6468f.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience (UX)

#### Key information for the site

This program was created with the idea of ​​being able to show the user's progress over time after joined and started at the Gym-Fitness (Project 1).

Project goals:

- To motivate people doing excersice showing their progress.

**Calculate body-mass index**

- When the user select the first option, the program will ask for their weight and their height.

- After inserting the two values, the program will calculate the body-mass index and show a message saying the index and the category which the user is in.
- At the same time, it will show a message if the user wants to save this record on a spread sheet table linked with the program. It will save the actual date and the body-mass index.
